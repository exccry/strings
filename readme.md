Important Considerations
1. Deadlock Prevention
Ensure Mutex Is Always Unlocked:
In all code paths, make sure that the mutex is unlocked before the function returns.
Use pthread_mutex_unlock before any return or exit.
2. Consistent Locking Order
Avoid Deadlocks in Multithreaded Environments:
If multiple mutexes are used in the future, always acquire locks in a consistent order across all functions.
3. Error Handling
Allocation Failures:
If memory allocation fails (e.g., in realloc), handle it gracefully.
In the case of critical failures, you might decide to terminate the program or propagate the error to the caller.
4. Performance Considerations
Lock Contention:
Using a mutex introduces overhead due to locking and unlocking.
If the registry becomes a bottleneck, consider alternative data structures or designs (e.g., lock-free queues, per-thread registries).
